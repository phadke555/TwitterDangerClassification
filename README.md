# Tweet Danger Classification
This repository contains code and resources for a natural language processing (NLP) task of classifying tweets as real dangers or not using NLP models and the Transformers library.

### Task Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze tweets from Twitter and classify them as either real dangers or not. The challenge lies in the ambiguity of language, as certain words or phrases can have different meanings depending on the context. For instance, the word 'ablaze' can be used to describe a forest fire or have a slang meaning in a different context.

### Model and Libraries Used
In this project, we utilized the Microsoft DeBERTa model, a powerful transformer-based architecture, for sentiment analysis and classification. The DeBERTa model has shown exceptional performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification.

To implement the model and perform the classification task, we employed the Transformers and PyTorch libraries in Python. Transformers is a state-of-the-art library for NLP developed by Hugging Face, which provides an easy-to-use interface for implementing transformer models. PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, was used as the backend for training and deploying the model.

### Results
I participated in a Kaggle Competition using our approach and achieved excellent results. My solution ranked in the top 25% of submissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented model and methodology.
