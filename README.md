# TweetDangerClassification

Used the Microsoft DeBerta model on the natural language processing task of sentiment analysis and classification. The task was to analyze tweets on twitter and classify them as real dangers or not. For example the word 'ablaze' can be used to describe a forest fire or in some other context as slang. Used the Transformers and PyTorch libraries in Python to complete this task and finish in the top 25% of submissions in a Kaggle Competition.
